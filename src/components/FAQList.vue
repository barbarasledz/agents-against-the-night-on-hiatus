Since the game starts you off with as many as 70 general points and 20 (or more) investivative points, keeping track of these points can be difficult manually. </p>
                    <p>There is a version of the sheet that calculates the values for you, but it requires using Adobe Acrobat and is not the most intuitive in its use. There are no pure web-based solutions similar to those enjoyed by other games, such as Dungeons and Dragons.</p>`
